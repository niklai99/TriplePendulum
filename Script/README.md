    4. Intitial angular velocities
    5. Starting time
    6. Ending time
    7. Number of iterations to perform

    Or decide to use default parameters, such as

    1. Masses equal to 1kg
    2. Lengths equal to 1m
    3. Initial angles equal to 135deg
    4. Initial velocities equal to 0deg/s
    5. Starting time equals to 0s
    6. Ending time equals to 10s
    7. Number of iterations equals to 1000

3. The user can also choose whether to plot
