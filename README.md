# TriplePendulum

The main goal of this computational physics project is to numerically solve the equations of motion of a triple pendulum.

## Script Folder

The [Script](./Script/) folder contains the main line of attack onto solving the problem this project is all about. In the script code, the RungeKutta 4 iterative method is used to integrate the equations of motion of a system, that could be a simple pendulum, a double pendulum or a triple pendulum. The idea behind the writing of this script is to try give the user a fully customizable system! 

More details, such as features, modules explaination and figures, in the [Script](./Script/) folder!

To run the script, simply run the [MAIN.py](./Script/MAIN.py) module and follow the instructions given.

## Lagrange's Method Folder

In the [Lagrange's Method](./LagrangesMethod/) folder you can find a notebook with the associated python module in which the goal is tackled through the usage of SymPy Lagrange's Method.

More details in the [Lagrange's Method](./LagrangesMethod/) folder!
