# TriplePendulum

The main goal of this computational physics project is to numerically solve the equations of motion of a triple pendulum.

## Script Folder

In the [Script](./Script/) folder you can find a few modules meant to achieve the main goal using the Runge-Kutta 4 iterative method. 

...more details will be added soon enough...

To run the script, simply run the [MAIN.py](./Script/MAIN.py) module and follow the instructions given.

## Lagrange's Method Folder

In the [Lagrange's Method](./LagrangesMethod/) folder you can find a notebook with the associated python module in which the goal is tackled through the usage of SymPy Lagrange's Method.

...more details will be added soon enough...
